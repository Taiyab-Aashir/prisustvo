**ABOUT**
	This app is an attendance maintaining app assisting the user to keep record of his attendance.
	This app can be very helpful for college going people as they have a hard time keeping record
	of their attendance.
	This app also helps office going community to keep a record of their attendance.
	The app is under development phase and further features will be added later.

**THE APP USES**
	What this app mainly does is asks the user to enter the name of the class, activity, etc. for
	for which the user wants to keep a record for.The user,then, is asked to enter the schedule of
	the activity like days and time.
	Now, here is what makes this app interesting.It asks the user to enter the location of the 
	activity.When the user will be within 50 mtrs radius of the place of activity on the specified 
	day and time, the app will record the user's attendance.
	This is how the app functions.
	The best thing here is that once the user has entered the details about the activity,he/she can
	simply forget about it,the app will do its work on its own.
	The app notifies the user whether he/she has been marked present or absent.
